                    <p>
                    All clients receive a unique proposal and contract based upon the specific needs they have for their project. Each project has a detailed service agreement that must be signed by the client before work starts, which specifies details regarding refunds, cancellations and project pricing.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Project Costs and Rates</h4>
                    <p>
                    Rates are determined per project based on the technical and skill-based requirements that the project outlines. All rates are based on accepted industry standards for the services requested.

                    <p>
                    A fixed fee or fee estimated not to exceed a specified amount is based upon the time estimated to complete the services specified in this Agreement during normal working hours.

                    <p>Remy Francis Web Development shall keep the Client informed of additional services that are required and shall request the Clientâ€™s approval for any additional services which cause the total fees, exclusive of any surcharge for rush work, to exceed the fixed or estimated fees set forth in the Fees section of your agreement.</p>
                    

                    <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Late Payment</h4>
