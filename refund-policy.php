                    <p>
                    All clients receive a unique proposal and contract based upon the specific needs they have for their project. Each project has a detailed service agreement that must be signed by the client before work starts, which specifies details regarding refunds, cancellations and project pricing. Please refer to your contract for specific details.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Requests for the final portion of payment due on all projects are not made until the project receives final, written approval from the client, or at 30 days after a project has been completed. Final payment is due within 15 business days once the invoice is received.
                    </p>

Refund requests must be made prior to Remy Francis Web Development receiving written or verbal authorization or approval of acceptance of services performed. In the event that the deposit amount does not fully cover the development time spent on the project, and other expenses related to development of the project, than additional payment will be due. Please refer to the specific details found in your project proposal and agreement
